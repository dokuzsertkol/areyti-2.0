Server and Client Architecture using C++ WinSock2

This project includes two separate Visual Studio project files: one for the server and one for the client.

Features:
- The server's user interface is built using the Windows.h library.
- Clients can connect to the server by entering its IP address (localhost, local network IP, or static IP).
- The server maintains a list of connected clients, displaying their IP addresses.
- Supports multiple clients simultaneously.
- Double-clicking a client's IP in the server UI allows interaction with that client.

Disclaimer:
Some server functions have been intentionally removed (e.g., accessing client files) to prevent misuse or malicious intent.
